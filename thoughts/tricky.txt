Shortcuts
- "preflight" checkers, eg in "expression" look for all infix operators first, then postfix operators, etc

- eg: `set {expression} to {expression}`
	- look for /^set\s+(.*?)\s+to\s+(.*?)`, the inner bits should be expressions.


Statements & nesting
- Assume that each line is a statement
- Special case look for `if` (and other?) control structures as aids in breaking things up
	- operators?
- Assume nesting implies block scope


Expressions
- Expressions are tricky because they're nested
- assume we don't have expressions on lines by themselves?


Identifiers
- Lots of things like "is", prepositions, etc are very bad identifier names
	- assuming single word identifiers
	- eg: all operator words???
- identifiers as nouns / adjectives only???
