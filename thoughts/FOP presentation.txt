Presentation

- vision
	- "non-programmer programming environment"
	- end goal:
		- layperson can write an app
		- customize / mashup existing apps for personal use

	- 3 parts to this
		- dnd app/component assembly
		- "english" for app logic
			- dynamic "human language" to "computer language" translator
			- other human languages eventually
			- "compiles" to JS for now
		- "marketplace" for apps / components / language extensions

	- example apps
		=> TODO


- Inspiration
	- HyperCard / SuperCard / etc
	- Inform
	- React (JSX)

- language particulars
	- Why "english"?
		- layperson can READ programs, even if they can't write one initially
		- "it's just english" leads to experimentation
		- code is self-documenting
		- "literate programming"
		- talking interfaces are coming -- semicolons and parenthesis won't cut it!

	- Computer industry moving farther from layperson accessibility
		- functional programming
			- too mathy
			- especially resurgence of lisp-like dialetcs

	- Every lay person I've talked about "english as a programming language" to has said
		"Why doesn't it do that already???"

	- examples
		=> TODO

	- language is dynamic
		- import new concepts (e.g. "bank account") to extend the language in your project
		- two methods to extend
			- programmers can extend the language in Javascript (using "rule syntax")
			- laypersons can automatically extend the language in the language itself
				- creating a new "type"
				- defining "actions" and "expressions"
		- curated "marketplace" of standard concepts you can pull into your app

	- language principles
		- everything in the language MUST be grammatical english
		- OK to use "basic math" concepts/symbols (eg: `a = b`)
		- multiple ways to say the same thing
		- embrace ambiguity
		- declarative as much as possible


- Parser
	- written in Javascript
		- Dynamic nature of language means not suitable for existing parsers (YACC, Antlr, Chevrotain etc)

	- Parser implementation is not important, language syntax/features are!

	- multi-pass algorithm:
		- tokenize "human text"
			- split raw text into tokens: "words", numbers, JSX expression, comments, etc

		=> TODO: pre-process text

		- parse tokens
			- apply "rules" to tokens to generate syntax tree
			- yields "syntax tree" of rule instances

		- "translate"
			- translate syntax tree into computer language

		- "compile"
			- compile computer language into executable code

Rules
	- named or ad-hoc parsing concept
		- e.g. 	`identifier`
		- e.g.	`declare_type`
	- rules can be optional or required
	- rules can repeat
	- "terminals" vs "alternatives" vs "sequences"

	- rule types
		- terminals
			- keyword			literal alphanumeric "word", e.g. `the`, `for each`
			- symbol			literal symbol, e.g. `(`, `=` etc
			- pattern			regular expression
		- subrule				named rule to parse at this point
		- alternatives			match one of a set of alternatives
		- sequence				match a series of (possibly optional) rules
								logical types:  "expression" and "statement"
		- repeat				apply same rule over and over
		- block					series of statements, uses tab-nesting (ala Python)
			- statements		top-level series of statements, e.g. a file
			- blockStatement	statement with possible nested block.
								e.g. method or type definition

	- rule syntax
		- this is how we create actual rules in our language
		- think: regular expression with sub-rules
		- core rules all written in rule syntax

Rule syntax example
	- `define type {type} (?:as (a|an) {superType:type})?`
			- `define` and `type` and `as` are literal keywords
			- `{type}` is a subrule
			- `{superType:type}` is a named subrule
			- `(a|an)` is an alternatives -- either literal keyword will work
				- `(…)` groups a set of rules together
			- `(?:as (a|an) {superType:type})?`
				- `(…)?` marks a group as "optional"
					- also `(…)*` for "optional and possibly repeating"
					- and `(…)+` for "required and possibly repeating"
				- `(?:…)` is a "non-capturing" group -- results get pushed up to parent

	- `define type {type} (?:as (a|an) {superType:type})?`
			- matches text:
				- `define type Card`, or
				- `define type Employee as a Person`

			- latter yields logical structure
				- define_type
					- type:			"Employee"
					- superType:	"Person"

	- actual definition of the above:
		parser.addBlockStatement(
			"define_type",
			"define type {name:type} (?:as (a|an) {superType:type})?",
			class define_type extends Rule.BlockStatement {
				toJS(context) {
					let { name, superType, block } = this.getMatchedSource(context);
					let output = `class ${name}`;
					if (superType) output += ` extends ${superType}`;
					output += " " + Rule.Block.encloseStatements(block);
					return output;
				}
			}
		)

		- "name" of rule is "define_type"
		- added to parser "rules" as "define_type" and "statement"
			- adding 2 rules under same name (e.g. "statement") converts to an "alternatives"
		- rule syntax expresses the rule
		- implementation defined as a class for graceful debugging in JS console
		- `toJS()` routine translates parsed rule to Javascript

Parsers
	- layered parsers
		- core
		- concept libraries (e.g. from marketplace)
		- user types = new parsers






=> ambiguity
=>


Problems
	- "left recursive" rules
		- eg:  "infix_operator_expression":
			"{lhs:expression} {infix_operator} {rhs:expression}"
		- most parsers require extensions gyrations in syntax to avoid this
		- autodetects left recursive rules
		- bails on non-productine left recursive rules

	- precedence / disambiguation
		- Currently "longest wins" and "most specific parser wins"
		- e.g. "the field is empty or the value of the field is 'nothing'"
			=> yields ((the field) is ((empty) or ((the value of the field) is ('nothing'))
			=> want	  (((the field) is (empty)) or ((the value of the field) is ('nothing')))
		- Currently can correct with explicit parenthesis.
		- How to build disambiguation / precendence into the rules?
		- TODO: UI for allowing end user to see options and provide disambiguation hints..

	- extending language can result in ambiguity


Future Direction
	- pre-process spell files to extend language automatically
		- e.g. "bank account"
	-
	- languages other than english
	- languages other than Javascript

	- looking for a project to partner with
