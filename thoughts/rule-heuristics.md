# Good rule huristics

- must be speakable by a native without cringing
- minimal typing to convert from grammar to example
	- don't do convoluted case conversion for no reason:  `the card` => `the_card` rather than `theCard`

- if a high-school educated person doesn't know what you're talking about, you're doing it wrong.
	- eg: simple math expressions are fine
		`a = this + that`
