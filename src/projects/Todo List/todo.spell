## Todo app example
a task is a drawable
a task has a title as text
a task has a property completed as yes or no
a task "is complete" if its completed is yes
a task "is active" if its completed is no

a todos-app is an app
a todos-app has a property tasks as a new List
a todos-app has a filter as one of all, active or completed

set app to a new todos-app
set the filter of the app to "all"

to create a task (with title as text)
	get a new task with title = the title, completed = false
	add it to the front of the tasks of the app

create a task with title = "Blah"
create a task with title = "Two"
create a task with title = "Three"

	if it is complete and the filter of the app is "active" return no
	if it is active and the filter of the app is "completed" return no
	return <tr>
		<td width="8%">
			<input 
				type="checkbox" 
				checked={it is complete} 
				onChange={set its completed to yes if it is active otherwise no}/>
		</td>
		<td width="82%">{its title}</td>
		<td width="10%"><button onClick={remove it from the tasks of the app}>x</button></td>
	</tr>
