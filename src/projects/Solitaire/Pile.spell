## Pile of playing cards
a pile "color" is:
	if it is empty return "none"
	return the color of its last card

a pile "value" is:
	if it is empty return 0
	return the value of its last card

// "move" a card -- make sure it's only in one pile at a time
// NOTE: this doesn't check if this is a legal move, use `play` for that
to move (a card) to (a pile)
	if the pile of the card is defined: remove the card from its pile
	set the pile of the card to the pile
	add the card to the pile
