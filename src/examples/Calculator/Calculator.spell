a calculator is an app
a calculator has an input
a calculator has an output
a calculator has a left
a calculator has a right
a calculator has a total
a calculator has an operator

to clear (a calculator):
	set its input to ""
	set its output to ""
	set its left to ""
	set its operator to ""
	set its right to ""
	set its total to ""

to update the total of (a calculator):
	if its right is empty: 
		set its output to ""
	otherwise
		if its operator is "+"
			set its total to its left plus its right
		else if its operator is "-"
			set its total to its left minus its right
		else if its operator is "x"
			set its total to its left times its right
		else
			set its total to its left divided by its right
		set its output to " = " + its total

to append (digit) to (a calculator):
	if the digit is "."
		if its input is empty
			set its input to "0."
		otherwise if its input does not contain "."
			set its input to its input + "."
	otherwise if the digit is a number:
		set its input to "" + its input + the digit
	// add to left or right field as appropriate
	if its operator is empty
		set its left to its input
	else
		set its right to its input
	update the total of it

to set the operator of (a calculator) to (op):
	set its operator to the op
	set its input to ""
	if its right is not empty
		// move total to right
		set its left to its total
		set its right to ""
		set its total to ""
		set its output to ""
