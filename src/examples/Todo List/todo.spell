## Todo app example
a task is a thing
a task has a title as text
a task has a property completed as yes or no
a task "is complete" if its completed is yes
a task "is active" if its completed is no

a todos-app is an app
a todos-app has a property tasks as a new List
a todos-app has a property newTaskName
a todos-app has a filter as one of all, active or completed

set app to a new todos-app
set the filter of the app to "all"
set the newTaskName of the app to ""

to create a task (with title as text, completed as a choice)
	if the title is undefined
		if the newTaskName of the app is "" return
		set the title to the newTaskName of the app
		set the newTaskName of the app to ""
	get a new task with title = the title, completed = the completed or no
	add it to the tasks of the app

create a task with title = "Create todos app", completed = yes
create a task with title = "Teach it to draw"
create a task with title = "Test app"

to draw (a todos-app)
	return
